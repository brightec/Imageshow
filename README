Drupal 7 Imageshow Module
=========================

This module bundles together multiple fields useful for making image
slideshows with support for text overlays.

Imageshow module supports text formats on the text field. (this feature is
currently not working and has been disabled, it will be fixed in a future
update)

A theme function theme_imageshow_formatter is used to generate basic markup
which should be good enough for most slideshows but can be overridden.

Usage
-----

Just add the module to your project and enable it. Once enabled a Imageshow
field type will be available when creating new fields.

Enjoy.
